'''                 PYCACHE(.PYC)
Pycache (.pyc) is  basically a folder that contains Python three byte code, which has already been compiled and is ready to be executed.
Basically, when I run a program in Python, the interpreter complies it into bite code first and then stories it in the Pycache.
The Pycache makes my programs start faster.
Especially whenI'm importing a module into another python file,he can make it faster.
They are automatically created after a module has been imported and used.
