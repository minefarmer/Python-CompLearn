'''                 PYTHON NAME ATTRIBUTE
Every module in Python has a special variable called name.
The value of the name attribute is set to main when the module is executed as the main program.
The value of the name can be set to another module if imported or module it is called from.
When I specify the name attribute in your Python file, you have to use an IF statement.
The if statement prevents certion code within the block from being executed.
The name attribute allows me to run Python files either as reusuable modules or as standalone programs, and the way I implement that, I use an if statement to check if the name attribute is set to main.
The if__name__ =="__main__" allows me to run Python files as reusable modules or standalone programes.
We are going to create two seperate Python files (modules), and import the first module into the second.
