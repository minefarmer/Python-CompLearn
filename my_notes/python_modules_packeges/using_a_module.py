'''                     USING A MODULE;
Once I create a module, you can use the module in any python file.
    import module_name
If the module has differient types of objects and I want to access just a specific object inside that module I can access it by using the FROM keyword.
    from module_name import(what I need).




'''
def say_hello(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)

fruits = {
    "name": "Grapes",
    "color":"Green"
}
