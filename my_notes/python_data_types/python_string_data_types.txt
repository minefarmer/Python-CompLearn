            PYTHON STRING DATA TYPE(STRING)

Strings are sequences of character data.
Strings are enclosed in either single or double quotes.
All characters between the opening and closing quotes are part of the string.
Strings can contain any characters you want including spaces.
A string can also be empty "".


>>> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
>>> print('Hey')
Hey
>>> print("Hey what\'s up")
Hey what's up
>>> 


            PYTHON STRING INDEX

All characters in a string have a specific index that is associated with them to identify their position or location within the string. 
So what that means is that you can tell what number a particular string is positioned within the string.
The index is 0 base.

>>> print("Hello"[1])
e
>>>
