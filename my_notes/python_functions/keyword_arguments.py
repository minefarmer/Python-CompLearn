'''             KEYWORD ARGUMENTS
Allows me to specify what parameters to use from a list of parameters.
I do not need to worry about the order of the arguments.
Allowsmme to give values only to parameters I want provided the other parameters have default argument values.

def more_num(a, b=7,c=10):
    print("a is ",a, "and b is ",b,"while c is ",c)

more_num(3,7)  # a is  3 and b is  7 while c is  10
more_num(23,c=17)  # a is  23 and b is  7 while c is  17
more_num(c=40,a=80)  # a is  80 and b is  7 while c is  40

# I can specify the argumentvalues in any order.
