'''             Anonymous Functions(Lambda)

They are defined using the lambda keyword.
They can take several arguments but can only have one expression.





'''
a = lambda b: b + 4
print(a(4))  # 8

c = lambda d, e : d + e
print(c(7,8))  # 15


# I can also use lambda functions when an anonymous function is required for a short period inside another function.


def ghost_number(n):
    return lambda f: f * n

double_num = ghost_number(2)

print(double_num(20))  # 40
