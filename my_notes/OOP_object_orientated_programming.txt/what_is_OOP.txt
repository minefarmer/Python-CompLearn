                OBJECT ORIENTATED PROGRAMMING(OOP)

Type of programming that breaks things into objects that interacts with each other.
Objects are created from classes.

Objects are created from classes.

Object Oriented Programming rncourages code reuse through D.R.Y concept (Don't repeat yourself)



            WHAT IS AN OBJECT?

An object can be an entity or anything in your programm like a noun.

Examples of real world objects includes things around us, like houses, cars, bank accounts, pets, etc.



            WHAT IS A CLASS?

A class is a blueprint(template) for creating objects.

Classes can have properties(attributes) which are like variables that store data.

Classes can also have behaviors(methods). These are like functions.

I can create many unique objects from a single class.



            CLASS CAR   

    Attributes            Methods
Color                   Start()
Engine                  Stop()
Door                    Reverse()
Brand                   Accelerate()


            CREATING AN OBJECT (Instatiating)

**********  INSTANTIATING A CLASS MEANS CREATING A NEW OBJECT FROM A CLASS   ************

When I'm creating objects from a class, it is called instantiating an object.

    Red    values for the attributes in the class.      Start()

    2 doors         "   "                               Reverse()
    Porsche         "   "                               Accelerate()
