'''         What are Variables?

Variable is basically a holding container that is used to store a value that can be referenced as required.
The value the variable stories can vary hence the name variable.
Variabls are parts of my computer's memory where information can be stored.
Variables are given names to identify and reference them when required.
Variables can hold values of different data types.


        Variable Naming Rules

Variable names are cass-sensitive : age and Age are dufferient.
Names can begin with Letters, $ or underscore_
Variable names can not start with a number ex. 247learning
Can start with lowercase word then seperate additional words with underscore. .e.g game_score (snakecase)
I can also use camelcase: ex. studentGrades.

Also, when I name my variables, try to give my verbal discriptive names that indicates what type of data or things that the variables actually truly stored.
