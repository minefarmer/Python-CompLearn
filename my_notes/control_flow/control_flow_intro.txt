                WHAT IS CONTROL FLOW?
It is the order in which the program's code executes.
Helps my program make decisions.
I ussually write code from top to bottom and when the code execute, it should execute from top to bottom, left to right.

    What can be used with Control flow
The control flow of a Python program is regulated by:

* Conditional statements (if, elif,else) are statements that only run based on certain conditions.

* loops are used to repeat a specific block of code. (for and while)

* A function is a piece of code that does something specific.

* A function call is when a function is called by it's name to exeute a cod, Example print().
