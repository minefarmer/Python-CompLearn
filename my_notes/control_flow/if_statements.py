'''             IF STATEMENTS
If statements are only executed based on certain conditions.
They help my program make decisions.
They only run the code in the if-block when the condition is true.
They use comparision and logic operators to check conditions.
If(condition):                                                     line. 21

a = 7  # a variable
b = 8  # "    "

if a < b:  # < an operator
    print(a, "is smaller than", b)  # 7 is smaller than 8  ## this printed because a < b is True

if a > b:  # < an operator
    print(a, "is smaller than", b)  # False - nothing was printed.
